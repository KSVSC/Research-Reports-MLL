# Reports

This repo maintains the summaries and reports of all the papers/books/other materials I read as a research student at Machine Learning Lab, IIIT-Hyderabad.


### Peer Prediction Mechanisms
This report gives a quick introduction to basic concepts of Game Theory and summarises most of the existing Peer Prediction Mechanisms and their related papers. This was done as part of my Honours Project-Monsoon 2019 under Prof. Sujit P Gujar at MLL, IIITH.

### User Reputation and Fairness in Crowd-sourcing-based Peer Predictio Mechanisms
This report gives a detailed literature survey of Peer-based Crowdsourcing Mechanisms. It summarises papers that use the Reputation Scores of agents to reward and incentivize them. It also covers a few papers that target fair reward mechanisms. This was done as part of my Honours Project-Spring 2020 under Prof. Sujit P Gujar at MLL, IIITH.

### Differentially Private Machine Learning
This report covers the basics of Differential Privacy (DP) and Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). It also introduces Local Differential Privacy (LDP) that is widely explored by researchers these days. Later it includes the summaries of a few recent papers on Differential Privacy and Multi-Armed Bandits problems that provide privacy guarantees using Local Differential Private algorithms. This was done as part of my Honours Project-Monsoon 2020 under Prof. Sujit P Gujar at MLL, IIITH.

### Cooperative Game Theory
This report is the summary of Cooperative Game Theory refered from 25-30 chapters of book `Game Theory and Mechanism Design` by Prof. Y Narahari. This was done as part of my Independent Study-Monsoon 2020 under Prof. Sujit P Gujar at MLL, IIITH.
